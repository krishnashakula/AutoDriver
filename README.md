# Driver Update Management System - Railway Deployment

## File Structure Required

```
your-project/
├── package.json
├── server.js
├── railway.toml
├── index.html (rename from paste-2.txt)
└── README.md
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Files
- Rename `paste-2.txt` to `index.html`
- Remove the PowerShell file (not needed for Railway)
- Create the new files provided above

### 2. Railway Deployment

1. **Install Railway CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway:**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize Railway Project:**
   ```bash
   railway init
   ```

4. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

### 3. Alternative: GitHub Integration

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your Railway account to GitHub
3. Import the repository in Railway
4. Deploy automatically

## Environment Variables

No additional environment variables required. The server will run on Railway's provided PORT.

## What Changed from PowerShell Version

- **Cross-platform:** Now runs on Linux (Railway's environment)
- **Mock Data:** Since we can't access Windows drivers on Linux, the system generates realistic mock data
- **Same API:** All endpoints work identically to the PowerShell version
- **Node.js Backend:** Replaced PowerShell HTTP listener with Express.js

## Features Available

✅ Web interface (identical to original)  
✅ Driver scanning simulation  
✅ System information display  
✅ Progress monitoring  
✅ Session management  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Real-time updates  

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080`

## Production URL

After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

## Notes

- The system now uses mock data instead of real Windows driver information
- All UI functionality remains the same
- Perfect for demonstrations and development
- Can be extended to integrate with real system APIs when needed
